# Good Ending
As you are walking down the path you notice that a wildfire is starting to form. With no where to run you start to panic, that is until the fire is suddenly put to a halt. You turn around to see that it was no other than a wizard who paused the spreading of the fire in order to save you. You became forever greatful for the wizard for saving your life, and the two of you fall in love and live happily ever after.
